Now that we know how to use streams, let's try another exercise and get to know some more operators
 * [filter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#filter-java.util.function.Predicate-)
 * [mapToInt](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#mapToInt-java.util.function.ToIntFunction-) â†’ this will return an IntStream
 * [sum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/IntStream.html#sum--)

@[Now, starting again from a list of names, give me the total number of letters in all the names with more than 5 letters]({"stubs": ["src/main/java/com/yourself/LetterCount.java"], "command": "com.yourself.LetterCountTest#test"})
